        <!-- <h1>Subject:<small> Application for Internship/Assistant Art Director Job</small></h1> -->
        <p>
          Hello Ma'am, I'm Punya Jayarajan, a final-year BTech student from Government College of Engineering, Kannur.
          <br>
          I aspire to become a Film/Advertisement Art Director like you. Could I apply for an Intern or Assistant
          position under you? Or could you guide me on how to pursue a job in this domain? I am fully aware of the
          challenges associated with this role.

          I'm unsure about the correct approach to applying for such a job and where to begin, as I haven't found any
          job postings online.
          <br><br>
          Currently, I specialize in graphic designing (including posters, brochures, and small video works),
          Illustrations, UI/UX design, and FrontEnd Development digitally. Additionally, I'm proficient in Pencil
          Sketching and Watercolor art.
          <br>
          While I lack professional experience in the film/Advertisement field, and my degree doesn't directly align
          with it, I have completed 3 design internships with different companies during my college days. I have also served
          as the Creative and Technical head for various clubs (Calypso, SHE, NSS, IEEE) at our college and contributed
          to decoration works during Art Fest and other college events.
          <br><br>
          I'm unsure if these experiences will be helpful for this position. Nevertheless, I'm determined to transition
          into an art stream after my graduation because art has always been a form of therapy for me. I hope you can
          guide me through this, as there are very few female art directors I could find online from Kerala.
